This project uses Python Scrapy to crawl data from North Dakota Secretary of State website.

At first run the ND_Data_Crawl.py using python3 ND_Data_Crawl.py in terminal to achieve all data related to this 195 companies that came up withhin the advanced filter of the website. I was not certain about removing company names that appeared in the search without starting with X.

Then run the Dataplot.py using python3 Dataplot.py in terminal to achieve another csv that has the useful four columns only for further data analysis.
